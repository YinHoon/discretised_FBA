# Discretised Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)

This method expands conventional FBA to enable reaction-diffusion simulation of single-cell metabolism. It discretises an individual cell into a two-dimensional grid, adds representation of intracellular metabolite diffusion, and simulates the system as a single linear programming problem.

# Dependencies

The method uses **COBRApy** and **numpy**.
